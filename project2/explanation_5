The Blockchain problem is implemented based on LinkedList data structure. Each block is added into the end of the chain.
The add() operation takes O(1) constant time. There is a find() operation for searching a block in the chain. The find
operation uses to_list() method, which takes O(n) time and space to create a list and it iterates over this list to find
a block. In general this operation will take O(2n) which is O(n) time. The find operation would be efficient if we
iterate over the linked list itself. For the space complexity it takes O(n).
