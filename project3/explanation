PROBLEM 1:

Finding Square Root of an Integer problem is implemented with binary search algorithm. To find a square root of the
given number we iterate from start (zero) to end (the given number) and on each iteration we find a middle, get its
power and compare with the given number. If the power of the middle value is equal to the given number we return the
middle value, otherwise we move to the left (start to middle) or right (middle to end) half and continue iteration.
In each iteration, half of the values is eliminated from the search. Its runtime complexity is O(logn) and space
complexity is O(1).


PROBLEM 2:

Search in a Rotated Sorted Array problem is based on recursion and binary search algorithm is applied to its implementation.
On each recursive call we find middle value of the given array and compare it with target number, if they are equal we
return middle position of the value, otherwise we search the left half of the array and if found return the value's
position or search the right half of the array, and if there is no value we return -1. Since we eliminate half of the
values on each iteration the runtime complexity is O(logn). The space taken by the algorithm is the same for any number
of elements in the array and its complexity is O(1).
